Data analysis involves employing generic workflows tailored to different types of data, such as epidemiological data, clinical data, or molecular data. These workflows include steps like data collection, cleaning, integration, and analysis, using statistical and computational methods to uncover trends, associations, and patterns. This systematic approach helps researchers and health professionals understand disease dynamics, assess intervention strategies, and improve disease prevention and control measures based on robust, data-driven insights.
