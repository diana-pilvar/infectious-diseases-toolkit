Showcasing involves presenting applied examples of handling infectious disease data to demonstrate successful strategies and methodologies. Showcasing these examples not only highlights best practices but also fosters learning and adoption of proven techniques across the public health and scientific communities. This is crucial for building a robust response to infectious diseases globally, as it encourages the sharing of knowledge and experiences that can lead to improved health outcomes.
