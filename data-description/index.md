Data description involves detailing the datasets used in research or surveillance. This, for example, includes finding and adhering to relevant (meta)data standards and documentation practices to ensure data are accurately represented, interoperable, and reusable. Accurate data description improves the clarity and dependability of information regarding disease incidence, transmission, and treatment outcomes, which is necessary for effective public health interventions and scientific studies. Good data description promotes data sharing among various stakeholders, allowing for more meta-analyses and encouraging collaborations to improve disease understanding and management.
